i failed this project.

pseudocode is definetly a skill i need to build up.
project planning is another. 

i also only gained the ability to implement SO MUCH of what was to taught to us within - literally - the last week... a majority of which came during the weekend. 

during the pair and group project i should have taken time away from those tasks to work on developing my skillset. i did not.

alas, essentially, it comes down to not having the experience beforehand to call on during the first weeks and build upon. 

i spent the first 4 weeks just trying to grasp anything while the tsunami of information kept rolling in. i did grasp concepts, but not enough and not quickly enough.

after spending the weekend tinkering with ICs to really understand how to use pry, dig into what the methods were doing, and reaching through methods, i was happy to have passed the Final IC. however, the weekend took a lot out of me.

ultimately, i do not have the skills to complete this project and, for a while now, i've known that i have not had the skills to advance to the next Mod.
